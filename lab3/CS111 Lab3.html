<div class="level2">

<p>

In Lab 2, we used a RAM disk block device to teach you about the Linux kernel
setting and about synchronization. In Lab 3, you'll learn about file systems by
writing your own file system driver for Linux.
</p>

<p>
Operating systems generally support many different file systems, from
old-school FAT (common in DOS machines) to new formats such as Linux's ext3.
Each file system type is written to fit a common interface, called the <em>VFS
layer</em>. (File systems are often implemented using object oriented techniques.)
You will see how a real VFS layer works by filling out a
simple file system implementation. You will load that file system module into
the kernel and <em>mount</em> the file system, allowing you to access your file
system with usual Unix commands like <code>cat</code>, <code>dd</code>, <code>emacs</code>, and even
<code>firefox</code>. The file system driver stores its data in a built-in RAM disk,
kind of like your RAM disk from Lab 2.
</p>

<p>
Like Lab 2, we expect you'll do this lab on <a href="http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/111/qemu" class="wikilink1" title="qemu">Qemu</a> using the <code>./run-qemu</code> script on your machine, or in the Linux lab.
Alternatively, you can also use a Linux machine, such as the Linux lab machines.

<div class="level4">

<p>

The file system you will work with, OSPFS, is simpler than most
"real" file systems, but it is powerful enough to read and write files
organized in a hierarchical directory structure. OSPFS currently does not
support timestamps, permissions, or special device files
like most UNIX file systems do. Additionally, your module is only capable
of using an in-memory file system, meaning that the data "on disk" is
actually stored entirely in main memory. This means that changes made to
the file system are not saved across reboots (or across module loads and
unloads).
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="file-system-structure" id="file-system-structure">File system structure</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Most UNIX file systems divide available disk space into two main types
of regions: inode regions and data regions. UNIX file systems assign one
inode to each file in the file system; a file's inode holds critical
metadata about the file such as its attributes and pointers to its data
blocks. The data regions are divided into large data blocks (typically 4KB
or more), within which the file system stores file data and directory
metadata. Directory entries contain file names and pointers to inodes; a
file is said to be <em>hard-linked</em> if multiple directory entries in the
file system refer to that file's inode. OSPFS is designed in much the same
way.
</p>

<p>
Both files and directories logically consist of a series of data blocks,
which may be scattered throughout the disk much like the pages of a
process's virtual address space can be scattered throughout physical
memory.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="sectors-and-blocks" id="sectors-and-blocks">Sectors and blocks</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Modern disks perform reads and writes in units of sectors, which today
are almost universally 512 bytes each. File systems actually allocate and
use disk storage in units of blocks. Be wary of the distinction between the
two terms: sector size is a property of the disk hardware, whereas block
size is an aspect of the operating system using the disk. A file system's
block size must be at least the sector size of the underlying disk, but
could be greater (often it is a power of two multiple of the sector
size).
</p>

<p>
The original UNIX file system used a block size of 512 bytes, the same
as the sector size of the underlying disk. Most modern file systems use a
larger block size, however, because storage space has gotten much cheaper
and it is more efficient to manage storage at larger granularities. Our
file system will use a block size of 1024 bytes.
</p>

" alt=" An OSPFS file system with N blocks and M inodes. " align="right"></a>
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="superblocks" id="superblocks">Superblocks</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

File systems typically reserve certain disk blocks, at "easy-to-find"
locations on the disk (such as the very start or the very end), to hold
meta-data describing properties of the file system as a whole: the block size,
disk size, any meta-data required to find the root directory, the time the file
system was last mounted, the time the file system was last checked for errors,
and so on. These special blocks are called superblocks.
</p>

<p>
Our file system will have exactly one superblock, which will always be
at block 1 on the disk. Its layout is defined by <code>struct ospfs_super</code>
in <code>ospfs.h</code>. Block 0 is typically reserved to hold boot loaders and
partition tables, so file systems generally never use the very first disk
block. Most "real" file systems maintain multiple superblocks, replicated
throughout several widely-spaced regions of the disk, so that if one of
them is corrupted or the disk develops a media error in that region, the
other superblocks can still be found and used to access the file system.
OSPFS omits this feature for simplicity.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="the-block-bitmapmanaging-free-disk-blocks" id="the-block-bitmapmanaging-free-disk-blocks">The block bitmap: managing free disk blocks</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Just as a kernel must manage the system's physical memory to ensure that
each physical page is used for only one purpose at a time, a file system
must manage the blocks of storage on a disk to ensure that each block is
used for only one purpose at a time. In file systems it is common to keep
track of free disk blocks using a bitmap rather than a linked list, because
a bitmap is more storage-efficient than a linked list and easier to keep
consistent on the disk. ("FAT" file systems use a linked list.) Searching
for a free block in a bitmap can take more CPU time than simply removing
the first element of a linked list, but for file systems this isn't a
problem because the I/O cost of actually accessing the free block after we
find it dominates performance.
</p>

<p>
To set up a free block bitmap, we reserve a contiguous region of space
on the disk large enough to hold one bit for each disk block. For example,
since our file system uses 1024-byte blocks, each bitmap block contains
1024*8 = 8192 bits, or enough bits to describe 8192 disk blocks. In other
words, for every 8192 disk blocks the file system uses, we must reserve
one disk block for the block bitmap. A given bit in the bitmap is set
(value 1) if the corresponding block is free, and clear (value 0) if the
corresponding block is in use. The block bitmap in our file system always
starts at disk block 2, immediately after the superblock. We'll reserve
enough bitmap blocks to hold one bit for each block in the entire disk,
including the blocks containing the boot sector, the superblock, and the
bitmap itself. We will simply make sure that the bitmap bits corresponding
to these special, "reserved" areas of the disk are always clear (marked
in-use).
</p>

</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="inodes" id="inodes">Inodes</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Each file and directory on the system corresponds to exactly one
<em>inode</em>. The inode stores metadata information about the file, such
as its size, its type (file or directory), and the locations of its data
blocks. Directory information, such as the file's name and directory
location, is <em>not</em> stored in the inode; instead, directory entries
refer to inodes by number. This allows the file system to safely move
files from one directory to another, and also allows for "hard links". Not
all file systems have inodes, but OSPFS does.
</p>

<p>
The layout of OSPFS's inodes is described by <code>struct ospfs_inode</code> in
<code>ospfs.h</code>. The <code>oi_direct</code> array in <code>struct ospfs_inode</code> contains
space to store the block numbers of the first 10 (<code>OSPFS_NDIRECT</code>)
blocks of the file, which we call the file's direct blocks. For small
files up to 10*1024 = 10KB in size, this means that the block numbers of
all of the file's blocks will fit directly within the <code>ospfs_inode</code>
structure itself. For larger files, however, we need a place to hold the
rest of the file's block numbers. For any file greater than 10KB in size,
therefore, we allocate an additional disk block, called the file's
indirect block, to hold up to 1024/4 = 256 additional block numbers. 
The 10th block number is the 0th slot in the
indirect block. This allows files to be up to
266 blocks, or a bit more than 256KB, in size. 
For files larger than this, the OSPFS file system supports doubly-indirect blocks as well.
A doubly-indirect block points to indirect blocks, each of which points to 256 direct blocks.
This allows files to be up to 10+256+256*256 = 65802 blocks.
To support larger files, "real"
file systems may support triply-indirect blocks as well.
See the picture at right.
</p>

<p>
Inodes are relatively small structures; OSPFS's take up 64 bytes each.
They are generally stored in a contiguous table on disk. The size of this
table is specified when the file system is created, and in most file
systems it cannot later be changed. Just like blocks, an inode can be
either in use or free, and just like blocks, a file system can run out of
inodes. It is actually possible to run out of inodes before running out of
blocks, and in this case no more files can be created even though there is
space available to store them. For this reason, and because inodes
themselves do not take up much space, the inode table is often created with
far more available inodes than the file system is expected to
need. (Remember, each file uses an inode, so the maximum number of files
and directories the file system can store at once equals the number of
inodes.)
</p>

<p>
In OSPFS, the inode table is allocated immediately after the free block
bitmap, and its blocks are also marked as in use in the free block
bitmap. The number of inodes is stored in the superblock, and for
convenience the block number of the first block of the inode table is also
stored in the superblock. (Why is this only for convenience? How could we
determine this value based only on the size of the disk?)
</p>

<p>
Even though your kernel module will not support creating new hard links
(unless you do that challenge problem), each inode in OSPFS has a "link
count", which is a number indicating how many directory entries refer to
it.  (The <code>ospfsformat</code> utility knows how to create hard links when
it creates the initial OSPFS file system for your module to use.)  If there
is only one hard link to a file, then the link count will be 1: only
one directory entry refers to the inode (the normal case). For each extra link created in
a "real" UNIX file system, the link count increases by 1, and for each
hard link removed, the link count decreases by 1. Technically speaking,
even the file's original name is a hard link -- it is no
different than later directory entries created for the inode except that it
was created first. If the link count reaches 0, it means that the inode no
longer has any hard links, and its storage space (both the blocks that make
up the file and the inode itself) can be marked as free and reused. You
will need to support this behavior when you delete files from OSPFS.
</p>

<p>
You may find the <code>-i</code> and <code>-l</code> options to the <code>ls</code> program useful.
The <code>-i</code> option causes <code>ls</code> to display the inode number of each file.
The <code>-l</code> option causes <code>ls</code> to display a "long listing" which includes,
among other information, the link count and size of each file. These
options can also be combined.
</p>

<p>
Here's a sample OSPFS file system.  It <strong>sort of</strong> corresponds to the <code>base/</code> directory we handed out.  (Note that the <code>hello.txt</code> data block is also linked to <code>world.txt</code>
 -- there is a file with two hard links!)  The actual file system you 
observe will be different; your first free block will be around block 
#106.

<h4><a name="directories-versus-regular-files" id="directories-versus-regular-files">Directories versus regular files</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

An <code>ospfs_inode</code> structure in our file system can represent either a
regular file or a directory; these two types of "files" are distinguished
by the type field in the <code>ospfs_inode</code> structure. The file system
manages regular files and directory-files in exactly the same way, except
that it does not interpret the contents of the data blocks associated
with regular files at all, whereas the file system interprets the
contents of a directory-file as a series of <code>ospfs_direntry</code> structures
describing the files and subdirectories within the directory. Each
<code>ospfs_direntry</code> structure just contains a filename and an inode number.
All other information about the file -- including size, type, and pointers
to data blocks -- is stored in the inode.
</p>

<p>
OSPFS directory entry structures are <em>fixed length</em>.  Every directory entry
takes up exactly 128 bytes.  The directory entry
design is explained in more detail in <code>ospfs.h</code>.
</p>

<p>
Inode number 1 in our file system is special: it is the inode for the
<em>root directory</em> of the file system.  Inode number 0 is reserved and
must never be used.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="hard-links" id="hard-links">Hard Links</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Files can take up a lot of space, and you may want the same exact set of
 data to be stored in multiple directories.  Hard links are a simple 
mechanism that lets you have multiple <code>"files"</code> link to the same <code>inode</code> structure.  Suppose the user runs the following commands:

</p>
<pre class="code">% echo foo &gt;&gt; foo.txt
% ln foo.txt gah.txt
% cat gah.txt
foo
% echo blurb &gt;&gt; gah.txt
% cat foo.txt
foo
blurb</pre>

<p>

In this code, the user is hard linking <code>gah.txt</code> to the same data that represents <code>foo.txt</code>.  So whenever either <code>gah.txt</code> or <code>foo.txt</code>
 is changed, both files see those changes, automatically.  This may 
sound challenging, but it's actually really simple.  The directory 
entries for <code>gah.txt</code> and <code>foo.txt</code> map to the same inode number.  For this, you'll have to just fill out <code>osprd_link</code>,
 which gets called whenever the user tries to create a hard link in a 
directory.  For simplicity, you do not need worry about or test hard 
links to symlinks. Only worry about hard links to regular files.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="symbolic-links" id="symbolic-links">Symbolic links</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

OSPFS also supports <em>symbolic links</em>.  This type of file adds a layer of indirection to the file system:
A symbolic link file essentially points at another file.  The command "<code>ln -s src.txt dst.txt</code>", will create a symbolic link
file <code>dst.txt</code> that points to file <code>src.txt</code>.  If an application asks to open <code>dst.txt</code>,
the kernel will examine the symbolic link, <em>follow</em> the symbolic link, and return a file descriptor open to <code>src.txt</code>.
For example, any changes to <code>src.txt</code> will show up immediately when a program examines <code>dst.txt</code>.
In OSPFS, symbolic links' destination files are stored in their inodes themselves.  See <code>ospfs.h</code> for more detail.
</p>

<p>
You are expected to add support for <em>symbolic link creation and deletion</em> to <code>ospfsmod.c</code>.  Test it using code like this:

</p>
<pre class="code">% ln -s hello.txt thelink
% diff hello.txt thelink &amp;&amp; echo Same contents
Same contents
% echo "World" &gt;&gt; hello.txt
% diff hello.txt thelink &amp;&amp; echo Same contents
Same contents
% rm thelink</pre>

</div>

<h4><a name="conditional-symlinks" id="conditional-symlinks">Conditional Symlinks</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

One nice thing about symlinks is that the actual symlink file can 
contain anything.  This allows the file system to interpret a symlink in
 unique ways.  For instance, suppose you have a networked file system 
(like the one on the Seasnet machines) that connects to multiple 
different architectures.  In order to use different versions of a 
binary, you currently need to set different values for the 'PATH' 
environment variable.  It would be much nicer if the a symlink could 
link to two different paths, and select the right one based on some 
condition (in this case the cpu architecture).  Doing this all the way 
is rather challenging, so we'll just start with a simple proof of 
concept; our conditional symlinks will be based on whether or not the 
current process is running as root.
</p>

<p>
Here's how they will work:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The following command creates a conditional symlink: "<code>ln -s root?hello.txt:bye.txt test</code>".  There are four important parts of this conditional symlink.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The conditional statement.  For this
 lab, it will always 'root?' which is true if the current process is 
running as root and false in all other cases.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The symlink for when the condition 
is true.  In this case it is 'hello.txt'.  Whenever root accesses this 
symlink, it should be redirected to 'hello.txt' automatically.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The symlink for when the condition 
is false.  In this case it is 'bye.txt'.  Whenever any non-root process 
accesses this symlink, it should be automatically redirected to 
'bye.txt'.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The symlink's name.  In this case it is 'test'.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Handling this properly will require several things: determining the user
 id of the current running process, knowing when the running process is 
root, knowing when a conditional symlink is being accessed, and how to 
interpret a conditional symlink upon access.  Some functions useful for 
this have been added to the <a href="http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/111/lab2functions#lab-3-functions" class="wikilink1" title="lab2functions">Lab functions page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example of how this should work:

</p>
<pre class="code"> # cd test
 # echo "Not root" &gt; notroot
 # echo "Root" &gt; root
 # ln -s root?root:notroot amiroot
 # cat amiroot
 Root
 # su user -c "cat amiroot"                        # run command as non-root user
 Not root</pre>

<h2><a name="building-the-lab" id="building-the-lab">Building the lab</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

This lab is designed to run within the Qemu emulator, like Lab 2.  So just run <code>./run-qemu</code> and press Enter at the <code>. go</code> prompt.
</p>

<p>
We have added new support for re-building your lab in the Qemu emulator 
(so you don't have to reboot Qemu to fix compilation errors and such).  
To reload your source, first type "<code>r</code>" in your shell window (where you ran <code>./run-qemu</code>), then type "<code>reload</code>" in the Qemu window.  Do note that this process <em>wipes</em> your <code>test</code> directory, replacing it with a fresh version.
</p>

<p>
This builds an initial OSPFS image using the contents of the
<code>base</code> directory. If you want to add files to your OSPFS image,
simply add files and directories to <code>base</code>, then rerun Qemu.  If <code>make</code> reports an error that
the resulting file system is too big, raise the number <code>512</code> in the
Makefile to something larger.
By default, the image created by <code>ospfsformat</code> contains two directory
entries which refer to the same file (that is, they are hard links):
<code>hello.txt</code> and <code>world.txt</code>. You can add more files like this by
adding hard links to the <code>base</code> directory using the <code>ln</code> command.
Read its manual page by typing <code>man ln</code> at a shell prompt. (Note: the
link counts on directories are always larger than one. Why might this be?)
The Makefile also creates a symbolic link from file <code>link</code> to <code>hello.txt</code>.
</p>

<p>
The Qemu environment then <em>mounts</em> the file system on an existing
directory, named <code>test</code>. This hides the directory's existing contents, turning the
directory into a "gateway" into the new file system. When your file system is ready, <code>ls base</code> and <code>ls test</code>
should return the same results (except for things like ownership,
permissions, and inode numbers).
</p>

<p>
It is worth discussing how the functionality of the script is
implemented. The following list shows the commands used:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Installing a module in the kernel: <code>insmod ospfs.ko</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Checking to see if the module is installed: <code>cat /proc/modules</code> or <code>lsmod</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Mounting the filesystem onto the <code>test</code> directory: <code>/bin/mount -t ospfs none test</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Unmounting the filesystem from <code>test</code>: <code>umount test</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Removing a module from the kernel: <code>rmmod ospfs</code></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="testing" id="testing">Testing</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

After implementing these functions, you should be able to do the following in
your filesystem: read and write to files, change the size of files, append to
existing files, read the contents of directories, and create and remove files.
</p>

<p>
Here are some hints for testing.

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We provide a large GIF file to test your handling of large files (with indirect blocks), <code>pokercats.gif</code>.  To see whether your reading support works for large files, run <code>zgv test/pokercats.gif</code>
 at the Qemu prompt.  You should see a picture.  (Press return to get 
rid of the picture.)  To test writing support for large files, try 
something like <code>cp test/pokercats.gif test/p.gif; zgv test/p.gif</code>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The <code>lab3-tester.pl</code> file, provided with the lab, works similarly to the testers from other labs.  <strong>You should as usual design some tests yourself.</strong></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

We have provided you with a minimal Lab 3 test script, <code>lab3-tester.pl</code>,
to help you check a <em>few</em> of 
the following test cases.  You are encouraged to add your own test cases 
to it as you complete parts of your lab.  
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of the test cases we will run on your code. Feel free to add these
to the provided testing script so that it checks these things automatically for you! You will
probably find the <code>dd</code> utility very useful to perform many of the tests. You
can read its documentation (<code>man dd</code>) for details of how to use it: check out
its <code>if=</code>, <code>of=</code>, <code>bs=</code>, <code>seek=</code>, <code>skip=</code>, and <code>conv=notrunc</code>
options. Also the <code>truncate</code> utility we included with the skeleton code will
help you test some of the cases. (Suggestion: compare the results of performing
operations on your OSPFS file system to doing the same operations on the normal
Linux file system.)
