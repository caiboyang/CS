<h1><a name="lab-2" id="lab-2">Lab 2</a></h1>

<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

In Lab 2, you'll write a Linux <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_module" class="urlextern" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_module" rel="nofollow">kernel module</a></em>
that implements a <strong>ramdisk</strong>: an in-memory block device. (A block device is basically a device that acts like a disk, supporting
<em>random-access</em> read and write operations of fixed-sized units called <em>sectors</em>.  Random-access means the disk can read or write sectors in any order -- unlike a pipe, for example.)
</p>

<p>
Your ramdisk will support the usual <strong>read</strong> and <strong>write</strong> operations.
You can read and write the ramdisk by reading and writing a file, for instance
one named <code>/dev/osprda</code>. (You could also initialize your
ramdisk to contain a Linux file system!)  Your ramdisk will also support a
special <strong>read/write locking</strong> feature, where a process can gain exclusive access to the ramdisk.
This, of course, leads to some interesting synchronization issues.
</p>

<p>
Like most device drivers, your module can support several of these devices
simultaneously; in particular, it supports four simultaneous ramdisks.
</p>

<p>
This lab has a handful of purposes, including:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To introduce you to kernel programming.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To give you experience in writing a 
device driver for a real operating system. (Although you don't have to 
implement any interaction with real hardware controllers.)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> To give you some interesting synchronization problems to handle.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

This lab <em>requires</em> that you use the <a href="http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/111/qemu" class="wikilink1" title="qemu">QEMU</a> virtual machine environment running a special Linux 2.6.18 image.
(While you can do the lab on a real Linux 2.6.18 computer, we don't recommend it.)
The SEASnet Linux servers, Linux lab, and CS 111 Ubuntu distribution have been set up with QEMU.
</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="lab-materials" id="lab-materials">Lab materials</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

The skeleton code you will get for this lab consists of:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a <code>Makefile</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> two module source files (<code>osprd.c</code> and <code>osprd.h</code>)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the source code for a utility to read and write a ramdisk (optionally locked) (<code>osprdaccess.c</code>)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a header file implementing the instrumented locking code described below (<code>spinlock.h</code>)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a script for running in Qemu on Linux (<code>run-qemu</code>) and a helper script that is run in the Qemu environment (<code>setup-in-qemu</code>)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a simple tester for some (NOT ALL) Lab 2 functionality (<code>lab2-tester.pl</code>)</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

When you extract <code>lab2.tar.gz</code> you will get a directory <code>lab2</code>
which contains these files. Since you will be using Linux for this lab, the
command <code>tar xvzf lab2.tar.gz</code> will suffice to extract the archive.

</div>

<h2><a name="writing-kernel-code" id="writing-kernel-code">Writing kernel code</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

Writing kernel code isn't actually that scary. The Linux kernel is a
very large piece of software, but you only have to use a small
subset for your module.  Remember that the kernel is providing the
abstractions we usually take for granted in userspace, so often it cannot take
advantage of them itself (sort of a chicken-and-egg thing).
</p>

<p>
Each process in Linux has its own <em>kernel stack</em>:
While the kernel is executing on behalf of a process, it uses a stack 
which is
specific to that process.  This is convenient, because kernel code 
running on behalf of a process can "block" similar to user code.
(Contrast this with WeensyOS 1, the MiniprocOS, where processes could 
not block in the kernel, and there was only one kernel stack.) 
Linux kernel code must be prepared to handle interrupts and symmetric 
multiprocessors without breaking.
Opportunities for race conditions are rampant.  It is very important in 
the kernel to use proper
synchronization mechanisms like locks to avoid unpredictable behavior 
and
deadlocks. Otherwise the whole system can crash!
</p>

<p>
In the lab skeleton code, we have
instrumented the kernel's locks to help you detect incorrect lock usage 
even on
machines where incorrect use of the locks would go undetected.  However,
 you won't be able to detect missing locks, so you'll have to think 
carefully about where
they will be necessary.
</p>

<p>
Memory protection is also not the same as it is in userspace. In 
userspace, if
you follow a bad pointer, your program may be killed, but that's about 
it. In
the kernel, the kernel itself will likely crash.
Even worse, userspace programs can pass invalid pointers into the kernel
 through
system calls. If the kernel dereferences such a pointer, the machine is 
in
trouble! To help the kernel protect itself against such abuses, there 
are
special kernel functions for dealing with userspace-supplied pointers in
 a safe
way.  You won't need to worry about these functions for this lab, but 
they will become important in Lab 3.  You will find them, and other 
useful kernel functions, documented <a href="http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/111/lab2functions" class="wikilink1" title="lab2functions">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can't call system calls like
<code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, or <code>write</code> from inside the kernel. You are 
<em>implementing</em> these functions for your block device; only user code can call them.
</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="running-the-lab" id="running-the-lab">Running the Lab</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

The hardest thing about real-life kernel programming is that bugs have very serious consequences -- often a reboot.
Virtual machines and emulators can make this much much easier: a bug will stop the emulator, but not crash the whole computer.
</p>

<p>
We expect you to complete this lab using a special Linux image we've setup for the <a href="http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/111/qemu" class="wikilink1" title="qemu">QEMU</a> emulator.
The lab skeleton code comes with a helpful script named <code>run-qemu</code> that will help you get started.
On the Linux lab machines and on SEASnet's Linux servers (or your own Linux machine, once you've set it up <a href="http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/111/qemu" class="wikilink1" title="qemu">according to our instructions</a>),
simply type <code>./run-qemu</code>.  This will start the emulator and copy your current directory into the emulated environment.
When the emulator comes up, it will say:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/111/_detail/run-qemu.gif?id=lab2" class="media" title="run-qemu.gif"><img src="./Lab2 CS111_files/run-qemu.gif" class="media" alt=""></a>
</p>

<p>
Simply press Enter.  This will copy your lab2 directory into the 
emulator, unpack it, compile the module, and install it.  Then you can 
test it, using
<code>./osprdaccess</code> commands as described below.  To run the <code>lab2-tester.pl</code> script we provide (which tests some, but not all, functionality), run

</p>
<pre class="code">./lab2-tester.pl</pre>

<p>

(or, equivalently, <code>make check</code>).  To run a particular test case (rather than all of the test cases), give the test case number:

</p>
<pre class="code">./lab2-tester.pl 15</pre>

</div>

<h2><a name="your-task" id="your-task">Your task</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

To complete the lab you need to complete all <code>EXERCISE</code> sections in
<code>osprd.c</code>.
This section of the lab manual gives an overview of the exercises and related
background knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Your ramdisk will be a <em>block device</em>, meaning it will implement the
Linux block device interface. Concretely:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Block devices <strong>store data</strong>. They support read and write operations.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> That data is stored in <strong>fixed-size units</strong>, called <strong>sectors</strong>, which the system can access in any order.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Even though the ramdisk could be more flexible, it conforms to the block device
interface so that it can be used everywhere a physical block device can be used.
The Linux block device interface also includes an <code>ioctl</code> function to perform
special per-device operations. You will use the <code>ioctl</code> interface to
implement the locking features of your block device.
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="reading-and-writing" id="reading-and-writing">Reading and writing</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

We suggest you first implement read and write support in your block device.
This is the <code>osprd_process_request</code> function. When you're done, you'll be
able to read and write data from each ramdisk by reading and writing the
<code>/dev/osprdX</code> files! To make this easier, we've provided a program called
<code>osprdaccess</code> that can read or write the block device.
</p>

<p>
To write data into the block device, use a command like
</p>
<pre class="code">  echo DataForRamDisk | ./osprdaccess -w</pre>

<p>
The <code>osprdaccess -w</code> command reads data from standard input and writes it to
the ramdisk.  It writes to <code>/dev/osprda</code> by default, but you can also supply
a ramdisk name:
</p>
<pre class="code">  echo DataForRamDisk | ./osprdaccess -w /dev/osprdb</pre>

<p>
You can also write the contents of a file into the ramdisk.
</p>
<pre class="code">  ./osprdaccess -w &lt; whatever.txt</pre>

<p>
You can limit the amount of data written; this writes at most 128 bytes:
</p>
<pre class="code">  ./osprdaccess -w 128 &lt; whatever.txt</pre>

<p>
And you can write starting at an offset into the file.  This writes the third sector (bytes 1024-1535).
</p>
<pre class="code">  ./osprdaccess -o 1024 -w 512 &lt; whatever.txt</pre>

<p>

The <code>./osprdaccess -r</code> command reads data from the ramdisk and writes it to
standard output.  It takes very similar arguments.  For instance, this command
reads bytes 12-15 of <code>/dev/osprdc</code> and prints them to standard output.
</p>
<pre class="code">  ./osprdaccess -o 12 -r 4 /dev/osprdc</pre>

<p>

Here are some more examples.

</p>
<pre class="code"> % ./osprdaccess -r 512 | hexdump -C

 .......</pre>

</div>

<h4><a name="locking" id="locking">Locking</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

Next, you will implement support for locking. A write lock guarantees exclusive access to the ramdisk -- 
no other readers or writers have access to the ramdisk. We've designed 
the interface as follows.  Assume that process P has a file descriptor <code>fd</code> that points to a ramdisk.

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>ioctl(fd, OSPRDIOCACQUIRE);</code></div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This system call acquires a lock on the ramdisk file.  If <code>fd</code> was opened for reading (<code>O_RDONLY</code>), then the system call requests a read lock.  If <code>fd</code> was opened for writing (<code>O_WRONLY</code> or <code>O_RDWR</code>), then the system call requests a write lock.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>ioctl(fd, OSPRDIOCRELEASE);</code></div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This system call releases any lock on the ramdisk file.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> In addition, closing <code>fd</code> will release any lock on the ramdisk file.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>ioctl(fd, OSPRDIOCTRYACQUIRE);</code></div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> This system call <em>attempts</em> to acquire a lock on the ramdisk file.  This is just like OSPRDIOCACQUIRE, except that the acquire operation would block.  <code>OSPRDIOCTRYACQUIRE</code> never blocks; it returns the <code>EBUSY</code> error instead.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

The interface works as follows.

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A request for a read lock on a ramdisk file will block until no other files on that ramdisk have a write lock.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A request for a write lock on a ramdisk file will block until no other files on that ramdisk have a read <strong>or</strong> write lock.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Lock requests are served in the 
order in which they are received.  Thus, for example, if P1 requests the
 write lock, and then P2 requests the read lock for the same ramdisk, 
then P1's request is served first and P2's request will be blocked until
 P1 has released the write lock.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

To implement these semantics, you will need to maintain a wait queue per
 ramdisk, so that processes that are blocked can be placed on the wait 
queue.  You also keep track of how many files are open for a given 
ramdisk for reading and for writing.
</p>

<p>
The <code>osprdaccess</code> program's <code>-l</code> option will open the ramdisk and then request a lock before performing the read or write. The <code>-l</code> flag optionally takes a parameter that indicates a delay to wait after opening and before locking the disk.  The <code>-d</code>
 option allows you to specify a delay to wait after opening (and 
possibly locking) the disk, but before performing the read or write and 
closing the disk.  The <code>-L</code> option is like <code>-l</code>, but uses TRYACQUIRE instead of ACQUIRE.  You can use these functions to test the locking feature.

</p>
<pre class="code">    # First, zero out the ramdisk.  We do this after each set of commands.
 % ./osprdaccess -w -z</pre>
<pre class="code">    # This command writes "foo\n" into the first four bytes of the ramdisk,
    # as we can see when we read those bytes back out.
 % echo foo | ./osprdaccess -w
 % ./osprdaccess -r 4
 foo</pre>
<pre class="code">    # This command has the same effect, but the "-d 5" option tells the first
    # osprdaccess to wait 5 seconds after opening the ramdisk, but before
    # writing.
 % echo foo | ./osprdaccess -w -d 5
 [[WAITS 5 SECONDS]]
 % ./osprdaccess -r 4
 foo</pre>
<pre class="code">    # Now let's play with some locks!  Run the first osprdaccess
    # in the background, then try to run the second.  The second should wait
    # for the first to complete.  It is easiest to get this to work if you "tee up"
    # both commands in adjacent terminals, then press return on the two
    # terminals in the correct order.  Or you can make the delay bigger so you
    # have time to type (or paste) the second command.
 % echo foo | ./osprdaccess -w -l -d 5 &amp;
 [1]
 % ./osprdaccess -r 4 -l
 [[WAITS 5 SECONDS]]
 foo</pre>
<pre class="code">    # If we don't use locking, the read and write proceed in parallel.
 % ./osprdaccess -w -z
 % echo foo | ./osprdaccess -w -d 5 &amp;
 % ./osprdaccess -r 4
 [[returns four 0 characters right away]]</pre>
<pre class="code">    # Note that two locking reads can proceed in parallel.
 % echo foo | ./osprdaccess -w
 % ./osprdaccess -r 4 -l -d 5 &amp;
 [1]
 % ./osprdaccess -r 4 -l
 foo      [[returns right away, then after 5 seconds:]]
 foo</pre>
<pre class="code">    # But a locking read will not allow a locking write.
 % ./osprdaccess -r 4 -l -d 5 &amp;
 [1]
 % echo bar | ./osprdaccess -w -l
 [[WAITS 5 SECONDS]]</pre>
<pre class="code">   # As we can see when we use TRYACQUIRE.
 % ./osprdaccess -r 4 -l -d 5 &amp;
 [1]
 % echo bar | ./osprdaccess -w -L
 ioctl OSPRDIOCTRYACQUIRE: Device or resource busy
 
   # Locking the same ramdisk twice would cause deadlock!
 % echo foo | ./osprdaccess -w -l /dev/osprda /dev/osprda
 ioctl OSPRDIOCACQUIRE: Resource deadlock avoided</pre>

<p>

The examples above are not exhaustive.  Make sure to come up with your 
own examples to thoroughly test your locking implementation.
</p>

<p>
Make sure you protect modifications to shared state with the <code>osprd_info_t</code>'s <code>mutex</code> member.  This is a <em>spin lock</em>,
 or polling mutex.  Remember that it is illegal in Linux for a process 
to block while holding a spin lock!  (This is because another thread 
could then attempt to lock the spin lock, and spin forever.)  You will 
have to arrange your code in later steps so that you always release the 
spin lock before blocking and re-acquire it afterwards.
</p>

<p>
You can either implement locking support all at once, or you can go more
 gradually. To go gradually, first change osprd_ioctl to implement 
mutual exclusion: make sure that lock requests don't complete until the 
conditions described in the locking rules are met.  You can do this 
without blocking. Instead, call schedule() if a lock request cannot 
currently complete and then re-check the condition when you wake up 
(when schedule returns).  Use the <code>ticket</code> members of <code>osprd_info_t</code> to serve lock requests in FIFO order.  (<code>schedule</code> and other important kernel functions are defined <a href="http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/111/lab2functions" class="wikilink1" title="lab2functions">here</a>.  <strong>MAKE SURE YOU READ THAT PAGE!</strong>  The <code>ticket_head</code> and <code>ticket_tail</code> members are effectively an eventcount and a sequencer.)
</p>

<p>
Second, support <em>blocking</em>, using the <code>wait_queue</code> 
functions.  To implement blocking, you need code to begin blocking in 
the OSPRDIOCACQUIRE case of osprd_ioctl (this is a trivial change if you
 use <code>wait_event_interruptible</code>), and you need code to wake up blocking processes in osprd_release and in the OSPRDIOCRELEASE case of osprd_ioctl.
</p>

<p>
Signals are a tricky aspect of this interface. Remember that signals
are a way to send a running process asynchronous events, or to kill a running
process. If the process is
blocked in the kernel -- for instance, if it is blocked in
<code>osprd_ioctl</code> -- then the kernel must wake up so the process can process the
signal. Since we want to kill blocked processes, they had better be able
to handle signals. This means:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> When blocked, processes should use an <em>interruptible wait</em>.
 This means that signal delivery takes place as usual.  (In an 
uninterruptable wait, you would not be able to kill a waiting processes 
except by causing the event it was waiting for -- and this would, in 
turn, prevent your module from being unloaded because it is currently 
blocked by code in your module. You'd have to reboot a lot!)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> When your process receives a signal, it will wake up.  If a signal was received (see the <code>signal_pending</code> function, or <code>-ERESTARTSYS</code> return value), <code>osprd_ioctl</code> should <strong>immediately return</strong> to its caller.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Test your code using test cases like those above (<strong>AND OTHERS you come up with yourself</strong>).
</p>

</div>

<h4><a name="deadlock" id="deadlock">Deadlock</a></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>

So far, so good!  But there's a problem: An ACQUIRE operation might 
cause a deadlock.  (Note that TRYACQUIRE could never cause deadlock -- 
why not?)  Your job is to detect these deadlocks.  Instead of blocking 
forever (or until a signal), your code should return <code>-EDEADLK</code>, a special error code that indicates a deadlock was avoided.
</p>

<p>
One easy case of deadlock is indicated above.  For full credit, you should detect <strong>any</strong>
 possible deadlock condition, but we will put most grading weight on 
simple deadlock cases where a process is waiting directly for itself.
</p>

<p>
The <code>lab2-tester.pl</code> <strong>DOES NOT TEST DEADLOCK AVOIDANCE</strong>.  Come up with your own test cases.
</p>

</div>


<h2><a name="getting-debugging-output" id="getting-debugging-output">Getting debugging output</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

Messages you print with <code>printk</code> or <code>eprintk</code> from your module may not be
shown on the screen by default, which can make debugging a little difficult. If
you find that this is the case, you can get a list of the messages by running
the <code>dmesg</code> program. On the lab machines, you may need to run it via
<code>sudo</code> as described above for <code>insmod</code> and <code>rmmod</code>; if so,
you may also need to specify its full path: <code>/bin/dmesg</code>. We found that
<code>eprintk</code> messages were actually sent to all open terminals on the lab
machines, so you may want to use <code>printk</code> and <code>dmesg</code> instead.
</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="using-your-module" id="using-your-module">Using your module</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>

After loading your module, you'll probably want to try using it. To do this, you
will have to access the <em>block special files</em> in <code>/dev</code> which
represent the devices it controls. If you are using your own machine, these
files may not exist yet (depending on a variety of things). Look in
<code>/dev</code> to see if you have files named <code>osprda</code>, <code>osprdb</code>,
<code>osprdc</code>, and <code>osprdd</code>. If so, you're all set. If not, run the
<code>create-devs</code> script as <code>root</code> to create them.
</p>

<p>
These files are not like other files in your filesystem. They do not actually
contain any data; they just "represent" the devices your driver controls. The
only reason they are there is so programs can call <code>open</code> on them to get file
descriptors which the kernel knows are connected to particular devices. However,
this property means that many programs can use them just as if they were normal
files. This is part of the UNIX design philosophy that "everything is a
file."
</p>

<p>
So, to use your devices and thus your module, you just need a program which
will open the block special files and read from or write to them. We have
included the <code>osprdaccess.c</code> code for this purpose, but you can also
write your own program to do it. If you write your own program, you may want to
look into the <code>read</code> (<code>man 2 read</code>) and <code>write</code> (<code>man 2
write</code>) system calls.

When you are finished, edit the file named <code>answers.txt</code> and follow the
instructions at the top of the file to fill in your name(s), student ID(s),
email address(es), short descriptions of any extra credit or challenge problems
you did, any known limitations of your code (including known bugs), and any
other information you'd like us to have.
</p>

<p>
Then run "<code>make tarball</code>" which will generate a file
<code>lab2-<em>yourusername</em>.tar.gz</code> inside the lab2 directory.
Upload this file to CourseWeb using a web browser to turn in the project.
Remember to upload it only once if you are working in a team - the <code>answers.txt</code>
file will allow us to give both team members credit.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Good luck!</strong>
