1. First of all, we add subshell parse feature by using recurrsion.
   However, we found out that when we test the -p option in lnxsrv,
   it actually print out some unreadable characters for only first line of command
   But problem disappear in our local machine. We guess that it's about memory size and performance
   differences in our local machine and lnxsrv machines.

2. Another bug we found is that the file which fetch into ./timetrash -p command cannot large than 1024
   Otherwise there are some strange characters appears.

3. the main algorithm we use in lab1b is recurrsion. It's pretty straightforward.
   In subshell type, we redo the input and output situation.
   In seq type, we return only he most right command's exit status.
   In very last, we use orginal fd to overwrite the stdin and stdout to make sure that
   when enter a type that is compounded command (which contained pipe) happened,
   it clean's stdin and stdout so that following command who read from stdin won't be affect by result from the pipe.

4. We also encounter a problem that when output to a file, we cannot write into it.
   However it does not happen couple days before. Fornuately, we fix it by manually set permission to "0644"
   in open() function, which we did not do before.




lab1a:
on the part we parse the input into command
we assign priority to each operator such as '|' '&&' '||'
so program will switch the command component to fill the priority, ex a&&b | c
And we do not implement subshell functionality
